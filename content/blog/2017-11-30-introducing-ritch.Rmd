Recently I was faced with a file compressed in NASDAQ's ITCH-protocol, as I wasn't able to find an R-package that parses and loads the file to R for me, I spent (probably) way to much time to write one, so here it is.
But you might wonder, what exactly is ITCH and why should I care? Well, ITCH is the outbound protocol NASDAQ uses to communicate market data to its clients, that is, all information including market status, orders, trades, circuit breakers, etc.
with nanosecond timestamps for each day and each exchange.
Kinda a must-have if you are looking into market microstructure, a good-to-have-looked-into-it if you are interested in general finance and/or if you are interested in data analytics and large structured datasets.
If you are wondering where you might get some of these fancy datasets in the first place, I have good news for you.
NASDAQ provides some sample datasets (6 days for 3 exchanges (NASDAQ, PSX, and BX), together about 25GBs gzipped) on its FTP server: [ftp://emi.nasdaq.com/ITCH/](ftp://emi.nasdaq.com/ITCH/)

## The RITCH Package

Now that I (hopefully) have your attention, let me represent to you `RITCH` an R package that parses ITCH-files (version 5.0).
Currently the package only lives on GitHub ([https://github.com/DavZim/RITCH](https://github.com/DavZim/RITCH)), but it should find its way into CRAN eventually.
Until then, you have to use `devtools` or `remotes` to install it 

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("DavZim/RITCH")
```

And you should be good to go (if not, please let me know!).
RITCH so far has a very limited scope: extracting the messages from the ITCH-file plus some functions to count messages.
The package leverages `C++` and the excellent `Rcpp` library to optimise parsing.
RITCH itself does not contain any data as the datasets are too large for any repos and I have no copyright on the datasets in any way.
For the following code I will use the `20170130.BX_ITCH_50`-file from NASDAQ's FTP-server, as its not too large at 714MB gzipped (1.6GB gunzipped), but still has almost 55 million messages.

All functions can take the gzipped or unzipped files, but if you use the file more than once and hard-drive space is not of utmost concern, I suggest you gunzip the file by hand (i.e., use `R.utils::gunzip(file, new_file, remove = FALSE)` in R or `gunzip -k YYYYMMDD.XXX_ITCH_50.gz` in the terminal) and call the functions on the "plain"-file.
I will address some concerns to size and speed later on.

To download and prepare the data in R, we can use the following code 

```{r}
file <- "20170130.BX_ITCH_50.gz"
# might take some time as it downloads 714MB
if (!file.exists(file)) 
  download.file("ftp://emi.nasdaq.com/ITCH/20170130.BX_ITCH_50.gz", 
                file, mode = "wb")

# gunzip the file, but keep the original file
R.utils::gunzip("20170130.BX_ITCH_50.gz", "20170130.BX_ITCH_50", remove = FALSE)
```

First, we want to get a general overview of the file, which we can do with `count_messages()` 

```{r}
library(RITCH)
file <- "20170130.BX_ITCH_50"

msg_count <- count_messages(file, add_meta_data = TRUE) 
#> [Counting]   54473386 messages found
#> [Converting] to data.table

msg_count
#>     msg_type    count                                  msg_name                                    msg_group  doc_nr

As you can see, there are a lot of different message types.

Currently this package parses only messages from the group "Add Order Messages" (type 'A' and 'F'), "Modify Order Messages" (type 'E', 'C', 'X', 'D', and 'U'), and "Trade Messages" (type 'P', 'Q', and 'B').
You can extract the different message-types by using the functions `get_orders`, `get_modifications`, and `get_trades`, respectively.
The doc-number refers to the section in the [official documentation](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/technicalsupport/specifications/dataproducts/NQTVITCHspecification.pdf) (which also contains more detailed description what each type contains).
If you are annoyed by the feedback the function gives you (`[Counting] ...
[Converting]...`), you can always turn the feedback off with the `quiet = TRUE` option (this applies to all functions).
Lets try to parse the first 10 orders 

```{r}
orders <- get_orders(file, 1, 10) 
#> 10 messages found
#> [Loading]    .
#> [Converting] to data.table
#> [Formatting]

```

 The same works for trades using the `get_trades()` function and for order modifications using the `get_modifications()` function.
To speed up the `get_*` functions, we can use the message-count information from earlier.
For example the following code yields the same results as above, but saves time.

```{r}
orders <- get_orders(file, 1, count_orders(msg_count)) 
trades <- get_trades(file, 1, count_trades(msg_count)) 
```

If you want to get more information about each field, you can have a look at the [official ITCH-protocol specification manual](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/technicalsupport/specifications/dataproducts/NQTVITCHspecification.pdf) or you can get a small data.table about each message type by calling `get_meta_data()`.

## Having a Look at some the most traded ETFs

To have at least one piece of eye-candy in this post, lets have a quick go at the orders and trades of SPY (an S&P 500 ETF and one of the most traded assets, in case you didn't know), IWO (Russel 2000 Growth ETF), IWM (Russel 2000 Index ETF), and VXX (S&P 500 VIX ETF) on the BX-exchange.
In case you are wondering, I got these four tickers with 
```{r}
library(magrittr)

get_orders(file, 1, count_orders(msg_count), quiet = T) %>% 
  .$stock %>% 
  table %>% 
  sort(decreasing = T) %>% 
  head(4)
#> .
#>    SPY    IWO    IWM    VXX 
#> 135119 135016 118123 117395
```

First we load the data (orders and trades) from the file, then we do some data munging, and finally plot the data using ggplot2.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# 0. load the data
orders <- get_orders(file, 1, count_orders(msg_count))
#> 21162665 messages found
#> [Loading]    ................
#> [Converting] to data.table
#> [Formatting]

trades <- get_trades(file, 1, count_trades(msg_count))
#> 330023 messages found
#> [Loading]    ................
#> [Converting] to data.table
#> [Formatting]

# 1. data munging
tickers <- c("SPY", "IWO", "IWM", "VXX")
dt_orders <- orders[stock %in% tickers]
dt_trades <- trades[stock %in% tickers]

# for each ticker, use only orders that are within 1% of the range of traded prices
ranges <- dt_trades[, .(min_price = min(price), max_price = max(price)), by = stock]

# filter the orders
dt_orders <- dt_orders[ranges, on = "stock"][price >= 0.99 * min_price & price <= 1.01 * max_price]

# replace the buy-factor with something more useful
dt_orders[, buy := ifelse(buy, "Bid", "Ask")]
dt_orders[, stock := factor(stock, levels = tickers)]

# 2. data visualization
ggplot() +
  # add the orders to the plot
  geom_point(data = dt_orders,
             aes(x = datetime, y = price, color = buy), size = 0.5) +
  # add the trades as a black line to the plot
  geom_step(data = dt_trades,
            aes(x = datetime, y = price)) +
  # add a facet for each ETF
  facet_wrap(~stock, scales = "free_y") +
  # some Aesthetics
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Orders and Trades of the largest ETFs",
       subtitle = "Date: 2017-01-30 | Exchange: BX",
       caption = "Source: NASDAQ",
       x = "Time", y = "Price",
       color = "Side") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

Now its up to you to do something interesting with the data, I hope RITCH can help you with it.

## Speed & RAM concerns

If your machine struggles with some files, you can always load only parts of a file as shown above.
And of course, make sure that you have only necessary datasets in your R-environment and that no unused programs are open (Chrome with some open tabs in the background happily eats your RAM).
If your machine is able to handle larger datasets, you can increase the buffersize of each function call to 1GB or more using the `buffer_size = 1e9` argument, increasing the speed with which a file is parsed.

## Addendum

If you find this package useful or have any other kind of feedback, I'd be happy if you let me know.
Otherwise, if you need more functionality for additional message types, please feel free to create an issue or a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/DavZim/RITCH).

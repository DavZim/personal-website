## Warning
After revisiting this blog 5 years later, I was not able to reproduce the code fully, see the addendum for a post-mortem.

## Introduction

Recently I found a good introduction to the Schelling-Segregation Model and to Agent Based Modelling (ABM) for Python ([Binpress Article by Adil](https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/introduction-to-agentbased-models-an-implementation-of-schelling-model-in-python/144 "Introduction to Agent Based Modeling in Python")). The model follows an ABM approach to simulate how urban segregation can be explained. I will concentrate on the R-code, if you want to know more about the Schelling-Segregation Model (which brought its creator a Nobel Price) and Agent Based Modelling you should head over to the binpress page! As my Python knowledge is not sufficiently large enough, I try to rebuild the ABM in R with some guidelines from the Python script, but as I use `data.table` and its specific functions, the code naturally deviates quite a lot.

## Schelling-Segregation Model

The idea behind the Schelling Model is that we create an `M x N` grid that contains homes for our agents, which we simulate to belong to `n` different races, with a certain possibility that homes are empty. In each round I calculate a ratio of same-race neighbors over the total amount neighbors for each home (position on the grid). If the ratio falls below a certain threshold (in this case 50%), the agent becomes unhappy and will move to another (random) home. This process is iterated to find an equilibrium.

## Basic Principles of the Code

The ABM is based on three self-written functions:

1.  `initiateSchelling()`
*   takes inputs of dimensions of the simulated area and the number of different races
*   creates a data.table called _schelling_ that contains the _id_ for each position in the grid, _x_ and _y_ the coordinates, the _race_ as well as _distance_ and _unsatisfied_, which we will use later
2.  `plotSchelling()`
*   takes a text input that is used as the graph's title
*   it uses the `schelling` data.table and plots each agent
3.  `iterate()`
*   takes the number of iterations (= number of simulations) as well as the similarity threshold
*   the function has another subfunction `is.unsatisfied()` that checks for each row if the agent is unsatisfied
*   iterate first checks for each agent if she is unsatisfied, if so the agent will be moved

## R-Code of the Functions

To fasten up the speed of the code, I use the `data.table` package including some of its specialties. If you are unfamiliar with the syntax of `data.table`, I recommend you to have a look at this excellent intro by [yhat](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/fast-summary-statistics-with-data-dot-table.html "Fast Summary Statistics with Data Dot Table") or the [CheatSheet by DataCamp.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/img/blog/data+table+cheat+sheet.pdf "CheatSheet Data.Table") For visualization, I use `ggplot2` and `RColorBrewer`. The packages are loaded with: 

```{r, eval=F}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
```

The code for the `initiateSchelling()`-function looks like this: 

```{r, eval=F}
initiateSchelling <- function(dimensions = c(10, 10), n_races = 2){
  # create "races" based on colours
  races <- colours()[1:n_races]
  # what percentage of the homes will be empty
  perc_empty <- 0.2
  
  # how many homes will be simulated
  n_homes = prod(dimensions)
  # calculates the number of agents
  count_agents <- floor(n_homes * (1 - perc_empty))
  
  # the characteristics that a home can have
  races <- c("empty", races)
  # the probabilities of each characteristics
  probabilities <- c(perc_empty, rep((1 - perc_empty)/(length(races) - 1),
                                     times = length(races) - 1))
  
  # creates the global schelling data.table
  schelling <<- data.table(id = 1:prod(dimensions),
                           x = rep(1:dimensions[1],
                                   dimensions[2]),
                           y = rep(1:dimensions[2],
                                   each = dimensions[1]),
                           race = sample(x = races,
                                         size = n_homes,
                                         prob = probabilities,
                                         replace = TRUE),
                           # used to find the satisfaction of each home
                           distance = rep(NA, prod(dimensions)),
                           unsatisfied = rep(NA, prod(dimensions)))
}
```

Secondly, the `plotSchelling()`-function looks like this: 
```{r, eval=F}
plotSchelling <- function(title = "Schelling-Segregation-Model"){
  # get races to get the right number of colors
  races <- unique(schelling$race)
  
  # find the dimensions of the grid to get the best dot size
  dims <- c(max(schelling$x), max(schelling$y))
  
  # plot the graph
  p <- ggplot(data = schelling[race != "empty"],
              aes(x = x, y = y, color = race)) +
    # workaround to get relatively large dots that
    # resize with the size of the grid
    geom_point(size = 100/sqrt(prod(dims))) +
    scale_colour_brewer("Dark2") +
    # create a beatiful and mostly empty chart
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
          axis.text.x = element_blank(),
          axis.text.y = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks = element_blank(),
          axis.title.x = element_blank(),
          axis.title.y = element_blank(),
          legend.position = "none",
          panel.background = element_blank(),
          panel.border = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          plot.background = element_blank(),
          plot.title = element_text(lineheight=3,
                                    face="bold",
                                    color="black",
                                    size=14)) +
    # fixes the axis to avoid distortion in the picture
    coord_fixed(ratio = 1) +
    # lastly adds the title
    ggtitle(title)
  
  return(p)
}
```

And lastly, the `iterate()`-function, that iterates over the checks for satisfaction and moves of the agents if necessary, looks like this:

```{r, eval=F}
iterate <- function(n = 10, similiarity_threshold){
  # subfunction that checks for a given x and y value if the agent is
  # unsatisfied (returns TRUE or FALSE)
  is.unsatisfied <- function(x_value, y_value, similiarity_threshold = 0.5){
    # gets the race for the agent
    cur_race <- schelling[x == x_value & y == y_value, race]
    
    # checks if the home is empty to
    if (cur_race == "empty"){
      return(FALSE) # empty houses are not satisfied, therefore will not move!
    } else {
      # creates the square of the distance
      # I avoid to take the squareroot to speed up the code
      schelling[, distance := (x_value - x)^2 + (y_value - y)^2] 
      
      # counts the number of agents that live less than two fields away
      # (includes all adjacent agents) and that are similar
      count_similar <- nrow(schelling[distance <= 2 &&
                                        race == cur_race &&
                                        distance != 0])
      # same here except that it looks into different agents
      count_different <- nrow(schelling[distance <= 2 &&
                                          race != cur_race &&
                                          race != "empty"])
      
      # calculates the ratio
      ratio <- count_similar/(count_similar + count_different)
      
      # returns TRUE if the ratio is below the threshold
      return(ratio < similiarity_threshold)
    }
  }
  
  # creates a ProgressBar, although this is not necessary, it does look nice..
  pb <- txtProgressBar(min = 0, max = 1, style = 3)
  # for time-keeping-purposes
  t <- Sys.time()
  
  # iterates
  for (iterate in 1:n){
    # fills the boolean vector "unsatisfied"
    # indicates if the household is unsatisfied
    schelling[, unsatisfied := is.unsatisfied(x_value = x,
                                              y_value = y,
                                              similiarity_threshold =
                                                similiarity_threshold),
              by = 1:nrow(schelling)]
    
    # move unsatisfied agents to an empty house
    # find the IDs that are empty where agents can migrate to
    emptyIDs <- schelling[race == "empty", id] # finds the id of empty houses
    
    # finds the origin of the agents moving,
    # aka. the old ID of each household moving
    oldIDs <- schelling[(unsatisfied), id] # origin
    
    # generates new IDs for each household moving
    # note that households can move to the house of other moving agents
    # also, agents can (by a small chance) choose to "move" to their
    # existing home
    newIDs <- sample(x = c(emptyIDs, oldIDs),
                     size = length(oldIDs),
                     replace = F) # target
    
    # a new data.table that shows
    # what race migrates from which origin_id to which target-id
    transition <- data.table(origin = oldIDs,
                             oldRace = schelling[id %in% oldIDs, race],
                             target = newIDs)
    
    # moves the agents to the new homes
    schelling[id %in% transition$origin]$race = "empty"
    schelling[id %in% transition$target]$race = transition$oldRace
    
    # orders the schelling, although this takes some time,
    # it is necessary for the other operations
    schelling <- schelling[order(id)]
    
    # updates the ProgressBar
    setTxtProgressBar(pb, iterate/n)
  }
  close(pb)
  timedif <- Sys.time() - t
  
  # print out statistics for the calculation time
  print(paste0("Time for calculation in seconds: ", round(timedif, 3), " or: ",
               round(n / as.numeric(timedif), 3), " iterations per second"))
  
  return(schelling)
}
```

## Results 1: 2 Races

By using the function I create a 50x50 grid with 2.500 agents and simulate 20 rounds (this process takes roughly a minute). A visualization is produced at 0, 10, and 20 iterations; after 20 rounds the 2-race simulation reaches an equilibrium as we can see by the few changes between the two states (10 and 20 iterations).

```{r, eval=F}
set.seed(42^2)
# initiate schelling
initiateSchelling(dimensions = c(50, 50), n_races = 2)
# plot schelling
plotSchelling(title = "Schelling-Segregation-Model after 0 iterations")
```

![](ssm_01.png)

```{r, eval=F}
# iterate 10 times
schelling <- iterate(n = 10, similiarity_threshold = 0.5)
# plot the result after 10 iterations
plotSchelling(title = "Schelling-Segregation-Model after 10 iterations")
```

![](ssm_101.png)
```{r, eval=F}
# iterate another 10 times
schelling <- iterate(n = 10, similiarity_threshold = 0.5)
# plot again after 20 iterations total
plotSchelling(title = "Schelling-Segregation-Model after 20 iterations")
```

Although it seems that the model found an equilibrium after 10 iterations, there are still some minor changes between the two states, albeit only few.

## Results 2: 4 Races

To see the ABM with 4 different races I used the following code to generate the following images. 
```{r, eval=F}
set.seed(42^3)
# initiate schelling
initiateSchelling(dimensions = c(50, 50), n_races = 4)
# plot schelling
plotSchelling(title = "Schelling-Segregation-Model after 0 iterations")
```
![](ssm4_01.png)

```{r, eval=F}
# iterate 10 times
schelling <- iterate(n = 10, similiarity_threshold = 0.5)
# plot the result after 10 iterations
plotSchelling(title = "Schelling-Segregation-Model after 10 iterations")
```
![](ssm4_101.png)

A more notable change happens between the states after 10 and 20 iterations.

```{r, eval=F}
# iterate another 10 times
schelling <- iterate(n = 10, similiarity_threshold = 0.5)
# plot again after 20 iterations total
plotSchelling(title = "Schelling-Segregation-Model after 20 iterations")
```
![](ssm4_201.png)

```{r, eval=F}
# iterate another 30 times
schelling <- iterate(n = 30, similiarity_threshold = 0.5)
# plot again after 50 iterations total
plotSchelling(title = "Schelling-Segregation-Model after 50 iterations")
```
![](ssm4_501.png)

Here we see that the model took more iterations to find an almost steady-state after 50 iterations (there are still some agents that will move in the next round, can you spot them?).

## Outro

These few lines show nicely what ABMs are, how they can be used and how they simplify complex human behavior. Although `data.table` is enormously fast, the process still takes a lot of time to calculate. If you have any idea how to speed up the code, I would love to hear about it in the comments! If you have any other questions or remarks, I am of course happy to hear about them in the comments as well. Lastly, if you want to see other implementations of the Schelling-Segregation Model in R, you can visit [R Snippets](http://rsnippets.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/animating-schellings-segregation-model.html "Animating Schelling Segregation Model") or [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/schellings-neighborhood-model/ "Schellings Neighborhood Model").

## Addendum from 2020

As noted in the blogpost, this code is horribly slow and does not produce the plots I advertised originally.
This is, of course, not `data.table`'s or `R`'s fault, but past me's.
Revisiting the code leads to some cringe moments for me as lots of pieces can be made more clearly and more efficient.
I guess I have learned a lot in the last 5 years.

Here are a few things I would do differently as of 2020

- not use global variables (i.e., not use `<<-`), instead each function should take the data as its first argument
- especially ABMs lend themselves to object-oriented programming as each state (of agents) depends on other states. Therefore `R6` might be worth investigating. 
- use a different code style: `initiate_schelling()` (snake_case) instead of `initiateSchelling()` (camelCase)

But most importantly: 

As this is a good exercise for more efficient programming.
For example, each round filters the data table over, creating unnecessary computation time.
Therefore, I ported the code to `Rcpp` and created a package some time ago.
Introducing the [`SchellingR`](https://github.com/DavZim/SchellingR) package.

Which has some nice features, e.g., emojis and/or animations as well as very fast execution thanks to `Rcpp`

```{r, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(SchellingR)
set.seed(1234567)
# run the schelling model on a 10x10 grid
sh <- run_schelling(size = 10, percent_empty = 0.2, 
                    threshold = 0.5, number_of_groups = 2,
                    max_rounds = 100)

plot_grid(sh, select_round = 8, title = TRUE, emoji = TRUE)
```
or even better
```{r, cache=TRUE}
plot_grid(sh, select_round = 8, title = TRUE, emoji = TRUE, animate = TRUE)
```

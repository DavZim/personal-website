title: David Zimmermann, PhD

I am David Zimmermann, a data scientist from Cologne, Germany interested in solving real-world problems using machine learning, data science, and other appropriate measures. 
In my past, I did a PhD in computational finance, where I simulated financial markets using agent-based models to find the effects of high-frequency trading. 

This blog was built with the intention to share different applications, tricks, and also some mild shenanigans with data, R, C++, Python, or other areas.
If you have any comments, ideas, issues, or just want to give me a thumbs up, leave a note or write an email to david_j_zimmermann {at] hotmail [dot} com.
